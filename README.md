# TASK-3-CODSOFT

# Aim -
Create a model to classify iris flowers into different species using their measurements.

# Libraries -
Used libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn.cluster.KMeans, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn.

# Dataset -
Used seaborn's load_dataset to get iris flower data with measurements and species.

# Steps :
1.Data Exploration

2.Loaded data and displayed the first 5 rows.

3.Encoded 'species' to numbers. 

4.Displayed statistics and checked missing values.

5.Data Visualization

6.Made 3D scatter plots for species, petal length/width, sepal length/width.

7.Created 2D scatter plots for species and sepal length/width.

8.K-Means Clustering

9.Used Elbow Technique to find the best K value (number of clusters).

10.Applied KMeans algorithm with K=3.

11.Predicted cluster labels for data points.

12.Accuracy Check
Calculated confusion matrix to check KMeans clustering accuracy.
Visualized confusion matrix to compare true and predicted labels.
